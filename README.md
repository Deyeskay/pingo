🛡️ 1. Truly Serverless & Private — Zero Data Stored Anywhere

“No server. No tracking. Just pure peer-to-peer chat. What you say disappears with you.”
No central storage means no one (including you) can access messages after the session.
Perfect for people seeking digital minimalism, anonymity, or ephemeral communication.
“Privacy-first chat — like meeting in a quiet room with no one listening.”

👻 2. No App, No Account, No Trail

“Talk without a trace. No app install, no login, no trace left behind.”
Good for: whistleblowers, journalists, travelers, friends in restricted regions, or just casual users avoiding digital fatigue.
Run it as a PWA (progressive web app) that opens from a single link.

🧠 3. Open-Source for the Privacy-Conscious

“Auditable, forkable, forever yours.”
People, orgs, or activist communities that don’t trust proprietary systems could fork and deploy their own version.
You stay lean but profitable via custom builds, branded deployment, or support services.
